Skewness and Kurtosis: Understanding Distribution Shape

1. SKEWNESS
-----------
Definition: Skewness measures the asymmetry of a probability distribution.

Types of Skewness:
1. Positive Skew (Right Skew):
   - Tail extends to the right
   - Mean > Median > Mode
   - Example: Income distribution (few very high incomes)

2. Negative Skew (Left Skew):
   - Tail extends to the left
   - Mean < Median < Mode
   - Example: Age at retirement (few very early retirements)

3. Zero Skew (Symmetric):
   - Perfectly symmetric distribution
   - Mean = Median = Mode
   - Example: Normal distribution

Real-world Examples:
1. Positive Skew:
   - Income distribution
   - House prices
   - Stock returns
   - Customer purchase amounts
   - Website visit durations

2. Negative Skew:
   - Age at retirement
   - Test scores (when there's a maximum score)
   - Time to failure of mechanical systems
   - Customer satisfaction scores
   - Employee performance ratings

2. KURTOSIS
----------
Definition: Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of a probability distribution.

Types of Kurtosis:
1. Leptokurtic (High Kurtosis):
   - Heavy tails
   - Sharp peak
   - More extreme values
   - Example: Stock market returns

2. Platykurtic (Low Kurtosis):
   - Light tails
   - Flat peak
   - Fewer extreme values
   - Example: Uniform distribution

3. Mesokurtic (Normal Kurtosis):
   - Similar to normal distribution
   - Example: Standard normal distribution

Real-world Examples:
1. High Kurtosis:
   - Financial returns
   - Natural disasters
   - Insurance claims
   - Stock market crashes
   - Extreme weather events

2. Low Kurtosis:
   - Daily temperature variations

negative_skew_data = -np.random.exponential(1, 1000)
high_kurtosis_data = np.random.standard_t(3, 1000)

# Calculate skewness and kurtosis

    skewness = stats.skew(data)
    kurtosis = stats.kurtosis(data)
    return skewness, kurtosis

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.hist(data, bins=50, density=True, alpha=0.7)
    plt.title(f'{title}\nSkewness: {stats.skew(data):.2f}, Kurtosis: {stats.kurtosis(data):.2f}')
